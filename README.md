# Php Reindent Nested Docblocks
Reindent nested docblocks (for example in swagger comments, ecc.)

## Motivation

You have worked in php projects like Symfony, Laravel, ecc. and you have to write a lot of docblocks. 

If they have a nested structure, for example when working with Swagger, you will end up with a mess.

So you have to find a way to reindent them.

If you usually do it manually, you will end up with a lot of time wasted.

So this project will help you to reindent them automatically.
